## Overview

SendGrid is a cloud-based SMTP provider that allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers. With our SendGrid integration you can send email campaigns, transactional emails, and automated emails (drip campaigns) from your app.

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

SendGrid integration supports API Keys. To authenticate, you'll need to create an instance of the SendGrid class and provide your API key. You can find the official SendGrid documentation to configure an API key [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys).

```ts
import { SendGrid } from "@trigger.dev/sendgrid";

const sendgrid = new SendGrid({
  id: "sendgrid",
  apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a SendGrid client, you can use it to create tasks.
