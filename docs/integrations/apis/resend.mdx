## Overview

Resend is the email API for developers. With our Resend integration you can send email campaigns, transactional emails, and automated emails (drip campaigns) from your app.

## Installing the Resend packages

To get started with our Resend integration, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/resend` packages. You can do this using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

Resend supports API Keys. Official documentation [here](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-key).

```ts
import { Resend } from "@trigger.dev/resend";

const resend = new Resend({
  id: "resend",
  apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Example

In this example we use [Zod](/documentation/guides/zod), a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

```ts
import { Resend } from "@trigger.dev/resend";
import { Job, eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

...

const resend = new Resend({
  id: "resend",
  apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!,
});

client.defineJob({
  id: "send-resend-email",
  name: "Send Resend Email",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "send.email",
    schema: z.object({
      to: z.union([z.string(), z.array(z.string())]),
      subject: z.string(),
      text: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  integrations: {
    resend,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.resend.emails.send("send-email", {
      to: payload.to,
      subject: payload.subject,
      text: payload.text,
      from: "Trigger.dev <hello@email.trigger.dev>",
    });
  },
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a Resend client, you can use it to create tasks.
